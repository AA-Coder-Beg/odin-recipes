The Odin Projects Recipes

<h1> What is this? </h1>
<p> This is a repository that is part of the curriculum for The Odin Project. In here, I will be making an HTML5 page that discusses recipes for certain foods. It is a work in progress, as I will be adding more variety to the recipe types. So far, I have added recipes that use marshmallow creme. I have not yet added any recipes to the peanut butter category just yet. </p>
